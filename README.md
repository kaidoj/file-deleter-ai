# File deleter AI - Simple practice, Deep learning ai

This ai is trained to find files that are older than three months and gives you percentage that 
it thinks which files should be deleted.  
Build this deep learning ai to learn machine learning. It works pretty well. I have few more goals. It currently has only one hidden layer.
It's using matrix algebra.

**Doesn't delete any files**

### How to run

Copy [this rar](https://github.com/kaidoj/file-deleter-ai/raw/master/juku/build/juku-ai.rar) and extract it anywhere on your Windows PC and run ```juku-ai.exe```.

### Todo

1. Multiple hidden layers
2. Confusion matrix
3. Tests
